This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## BookQuest 

BookQuest is an app designed to motivate young people to read by providing rewards for book-related activities that they complete. Users can search for books within the Google Books database, read their book in an embedded viewer, and keep track of their progress as they read. They are able to complete an activity called "Lit Tweets!" where they take on the persona of a character from their current book and write tweets from that character's perspective. Users have to ability to create vocabulary flash cards for new words that they discover in their books. For each activity, users earn points, which they can redeem to build an animated snowman scene. Users can also track their progress of completed activities by viewing a bar graph of how many activities they have completed each day. 

To run the project, open 'bookquest_backend' and run 'rails s.' Run 'yarn start' in the project directory of this repository.
